11/15 NYC Crisis Text Line project

## Requirements
You'll need git to clone this repository.  If you don't have git installed, check out [this guide](http://git-scm.com/book/en/Getting-Started-Installing-Git).

## Getting started
To use this code, you might need some requirements. To get started, you should
run
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Code
This repo is the home for all project-related code. Folders for munging, analysis, and visualization code have also been created.  Putting code in its respective folder will help everyone stay organized and productive.  A requrements.txt file has also been included.  If your scripts require packages please add to this file.  (If you're not using python, obviously add any other requirements files as well!)

## Goals, Tasks, & Documentation
Information about the project can be found on the [project hackpad](https://nycdatadive2013.hackpad.com/Crisis-Text-Line-Using-Data-to-Help-Teens-in-Crisis-o40NEtJz1Gn).  There you'll find details about the project Data Ambassadors, volunteers, tasks, and goals.

## Data
All of the data for dive-related tasks can be found on the [project dropbox](https://www.dropbox.com/home/CTL%20Public).  If you'd like to add data files talk to a Data Ambassador and they will share the folder with you.
